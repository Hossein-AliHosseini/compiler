# Compiler Design Project - Sharif University of Technology

This compiler will provide an efficient and reliable way to compile C-Minus code into executable programs.

The compiler will be designed with an emphasis on readability, maintainability, and portability. We will strive to make the code as clean and concise as possible, while still providing all the necessary features for compiling C-Minus code. The compiler will also be designed to work on multiple platforms, allowing users to compile their code regardless of their operating system or hardware configuration.

## Scanner Design

The first phase of the whole design is designing of the scanner part. The scanner part of the compiler will be responsible for reading in the source code and breaking it down into tokens. These tokens will then be passed to other parts of the compiler for further processing. The scanner should also detect any lexical errors in the source code and report them to the user. To design this part, we will need to define what tokens are valid in our language, as well as how they should be identified by our scanner. We will also need to define any special rules for handling comments or whitespace characters in our source code. Once these details have been determined, we can begin writing code for our scanner using Python's built-in string manipulation functions and regular expressions.
